# Final Project: Sokoban Game
This is the final project of the course Software Carpentry. This project implements a Sokoban game with two difficulty levels and includes a solver that can use various search algorithms to solve the puzzles automatically.

## Features
- **Interactive Game Play**: Play Sokoban with intuitive controls and navigate through different levels.
- **Two Modes of Difficulty**: Includes an 'easy' mode and a 'hard' mode with different levels designed for a range of skills.
- **Solver Algorithms**: Features several search algorithms, including Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A* Search, and Uniform Cost Search to solve the puzzles automatically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy library
- Pygame library (for running the interactive game)
